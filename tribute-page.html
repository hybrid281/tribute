        <h3>The father of the "Green Revolution"</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>He was awarded the Nobel Peach Prize in 1970 for combating world hunger and saving hundreds of millions of lives.
        <li>Utilized innovative breeding techniques to help create disease-resistant types of wheat, in turn producing more wheat than the standard type. </li>
        <li>This achievement helped avert famine on a global scale in the second half of the 20th century.</li>
        <li>"He has probably done more and is known by fewer people than anybody that has done that much," said Dr. Ed Runge, retired head of Texas A&M University's Department of Soil and Crop Sciences</li>
